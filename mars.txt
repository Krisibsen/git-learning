Introduction to the planet Mars:

Mars is a red planet with water. But frozen. 

Mars is just inside the Goldielocks zone... I think.

To do: Add about aliens on Mars. 

Some other stuff about Mars. Maybe something about the atmosphere or something? Apparently it is "composed of carbon dioxide (95.32%), molecular nitrogen (2.6%) and argon (1.9%)".
